This Python program calculates a student’s total marks, average, and grade for five subjects with proper input validation. First, it defines a list of subjects and initializes an empty list to store marks and a variable to track the total. It then loops through each subject. If the input is valid, the mark is stored and added to the total; otherwise, the program shows an error and stops. After collecting all marks, the program calculates the average by dividing the total by the number of subjects. Based on the average, it assigns a grade: A for averages ≥90, B for ≥75, C for ≥50, and F otherwise. Finally, it displays each subject with its marks, the total marks, the average, and the grade. This way,the program runs.
